The [suko_solved.py](https://github.com/sebsikora/pysmt_demos/blob/main/suko_solved.py) demo is cribbed more-or-less directly from the nice walkthrough by [David Cannings](https://edeca.net/post/2017-06-03-solving-suko-with-pysmt/)

The walkthrough shows us how we can define all the rules we need to solve a similar problem using the same solver, eg [sudoku](https://github.com/sebsikora/pysmt_demos/blob/main/sudoku_solved.py)
